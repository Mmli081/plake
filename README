# Plake (Iraqi Plate Detection)

## Overview

This project aims to develop an automated system for detecting and blurring license plates in car images, specifically focusing on Iraqi vehicle plates. The project involves data collection, annotation, and model training using state-of-the-art techniques to achieve reliable plate detection.

## Data Collection

- **Description**: 80,000 Images were crawled and stored in Drive
- **Preprocessing**: A zero-shot image classification model("openai/clip-vit-base-patch32") was employed to classify images into two categories: "has plate" and "does not have plate."

## Annotation

- **Tool**: The annotation of images was carried out using the Roboflow platform.
- **Dataset Size**: Over 1,500 images were manually annotated, identifying the license plates' locations within the images.

## Modeling

- **Model Used**: The YOLOv8-OBB (Oriented Bounding Box) model was selected for fine-tuning on the annotated dataset.
- **Training**: The model was trained and fine-tuned to detect license plates in various orientations and lighting conditions.
- **Feature**: The trained model is capable of detecting license plates in images and can automatically blur the detected plates to ensure privacy.

## Installation

To replicate the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
